print("imagine: The boy didnt send the letter so  she never knew the boy was in love with her and the boy didnt change of school, the boy  drops the letter and one person reads it in front of everyone and everyone laughs at him and bullies him, the boy hands him the letter personally, the girl tells him she just doesn't like it, but doesn't tell anyone")
